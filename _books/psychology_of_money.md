> "Reputation is invaluable. Freedom and independence are invaluable. Family and friends are invaluable. Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable. Happiness is invaluable. And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when itâ€™s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough."
