> "Reputation is invaluable. Freedom and independence are invaluable. Family and friends are invaluable. Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable. Happiness is invaluable. And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when it’s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough."

This book is honestly one of my all-time favorites, and it’s the one I always end up recommending to people. On the surface, it’s about money, but really it’s about life. Some of the lessons in there feel like things I’ll only truly get once I’m in my 40s or 50s.

Now, there are already tons of summaries out there, so I’m not going to repeat what you can easily Google. Instead, I just want to share a few things that really clicked with me.

## Chapter 1: No One's Crazy
> Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

People’s experiences with money—and life in general—are shaped by so many different factors. Think about it: we come from different generations, raised by parents with different incomes and values, in different parts of the world. Some of us were born into strong economies, others into struggling ones. We’ve faced different job markets, had different opportunities (and setbacks), and different amounts of luck. Naturally, all of that adds up to completely different lessons about how the world works. So what seems crazy to you might make perfect sense to me.

You probably know things about money that I don’t, and I probably know things you don’t. We’re moving through life with different beliefs, goals, and expectations—not because one of us is smarter or better informed, but simply because our lives have been shaped by different, yet equally convincing, experiences.

This chapter made me stop and think about how differently people act in the exact same situation. It’s not random, everyone sees things through their own lens, shaped by whatever they’ve gone through. And since I don’t know their backstory, it doesn’t really make sense for me to judge whether their reaction is “right” or “wrong.” What feels wrong to me might be perfectly reasonable to them. That really reminded me how important it is to practice empathy. It helps you get why people behave the way they do, and it also makes it clearer who you vibe with and who you don’t.

## Chapter 2: Luck & Risk
> Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.
