G'day, awesome to have you drop by!

I'm Khai, currently diving into my Ph.D. journey at the University of Queensland (UQ), Australia. Before the research journey as Ph.D. candidate, I earned my Master of Information Technology from UQ and Bachelor of Business Administration from University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City.

Right now, I'm on a mission to crack the question of *how to extract valuable insights from messy, unstructured text data to teach machines like ChatGPT answering our questions* by using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) and AI techniques, with a special focus on Deep Learning. More specifically, I'm honing in the challenge of document-level relation extraction, where the aim is to locate and extract relationships between entities within documents, whether they're sourced from Wikipedia or the biomedical field. This process lays the groundwork for constructing a comprehensive Knowledge Graph

I've also been working as a tutor at my university, where I've taught several AI/ML courses like [COMP4702](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=comp4702) and [DATA7703](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=data7703) since 2022, working alongside some incredible course coordinators and fellow tutors.

When I'm not immersed in my research or teaching, you'll often find me indulging my inner curious child with endless "why" questions, exploring everything from programming to finance, and spending time with my loved people. Beyond that, I'm a passionate soccer enthusiast—always ready to hit the field for a game ⚽. If you're ever up for a match, just shoot me a message — I'm down for any soccer invitation!
