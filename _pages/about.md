G'day, awesome to have you drop by!

I'm Khai, currently finishing my Ph.D. at the University of Queensland (UQ), Australia, under the supervision of Professor [Xue Li](https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/973) and A/Professor [Wen Hua](https://web.comp.polyu.edu.hk/wenhua/). Before starting this research journey, I earned a Master of Information Technology from UQ and a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City.

I'm passionate about finding ways to get useful insights from messy, unstructured text data to help machines like ChatGPT answer our questions better. I use techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI/ML, focusing on Deep Learning. Specifically, I'm tackling the challenge of document-level relation extraction, which involves finding connections between entities within documents, whether from Wikipedia or biomedical texts. This work helps in building a Knowledge Graph, a tool that links information in a meaningful way.

Since 2022, I've also been tutoring several AI/ML and Database courses like [COMP4702](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=comp4702), [INFS2200](https://programs-courses.uq.edu.au/course.html?course_code=infs2200) and [DATA7703](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=data7703) at my university, working closely with amazing course coordinators and fellow tutors.

Outside of research and teaching, I love asking "why" questions and diving into topics like programming and finance. I also spend quality time with my loved ones. And soccer? Count me in! I'm always up for a game or a good chat about it. Just invite me!
