UQ has granted me admission to its Ph.D. program at the university for the upcoming four years, from January 2022 to December 2025!

In this Ph.D. program, my research focus will be on **"Information Extraction from Large-scale Low-Quality Data"**. I will be under the guidance of Dr. Wen Hua and Prof. Xue Li from the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering.

In addition to the admission offer, I have been awarded the *UQ Earmarked Scholarship*. This scholarship is funded by the Australian Government and supports research projects of national significance, allowing scholars to collaborate with leading researchers.
