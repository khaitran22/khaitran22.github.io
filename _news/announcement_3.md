UQ has offered me the admission to the Ph.D. programm at the university for the next 4 years from January 2022 to December 2025!

Under the Ph.D. program, I will research about the topic **"Information Extraction from Large-scale Low Quality Data"**. I will be advised by Dr. Wen Hua and Prof. Xue Li from the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering.
