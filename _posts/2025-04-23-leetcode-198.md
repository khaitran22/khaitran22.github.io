A notes on the Problem #198 - House Robber on Leetcode when I practiced Dynamic Programming.

### Question
> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,  the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
> 
> Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Example 1**:
- Input: `nums = [1,2,3,1]`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2**:
- Input: `nums = [2,7,9,3,1]`
- Output: `12`
- Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1). Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

### Intuition
The core intuition behind this problem is:
> When standing in front of a house, you have to decide whether to rob it or not. If you choose to rob it, make sure not to trigger the security system by robbing adjacent houses.
{: .block-tip }

### Approach
With that in mind, I explored two approaches:
- **Brute-force approach**
- **Dynamic Programming (DP) approach**

#### Brute-force Approach
This approach considers all valid combinations of houses that can be robbed without triggering the alarm system. To do this, I generated all binary lists of length `n`, where each element is either `0` or `1`. A `1` at position `i` indicates that the `i-th` house is robbed, and `0` means it’s skipped. To ensure we don’t rob two adjacent houses, we filter out any combinations where two `1`s are next to each other.

Here's the implementation for generating those valid combinations:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def generate_binary_lists(n):
    result = [[0], [1]]
    for _ in range(1, n):
        new_result = []
        for lst in result:
            if lst[-1] == 1:
                new_result.append(lst + [0])
            else:
                new_result.append(lst + [1])
                new_result.append(lst + [0])
        result = new_result
    return result
{% endhighlight %}

Once we have all the valid combinations, we calculate the amount of money we can rob for each and keep track of the maximum:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def rob(nums):
    all_binary_lists = generate_binary_lists(len(nums))
    max_money = float("-inf")
    current_max_robbed_house = None
    for lst in all_binary_lists:
        current_money = 0
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            current_money += lst[i] * nums[i]
            if current_money > max_money:
                max_money = current_money
    return max_money, current_max_robbed_house
{% endhighlight %}

This approach worked for **47 out of 70** test cases on LeetCode. However, it failed with a `Memory Limit Exceeded` error on the $$48^{th}$$ test case due to the exponential number of combinations.

#### Dynamic Programming Approach
To address the memory issue, I turned to dynamic programming.

##### Observation
At any house `i`, you have two choices:
1. *Rob house `i`*: You must skip house `i-1`, so the total is the value at house `i` plus the max value when house `i-1` wasn’t robbed.
2. *Skip house `i`*: You take the max of robbing or skipping house `i-1`.

##### Step-by-Step Example

Let’s walk through the array `[2, 7, 9, 3, 1]`.

| House | Value | rob (rob this) | not_rob (skip this) | Explanation |
|:------|:------|:---------------|:--------------------|:------------|
| 0     | 2     | 2              | 0                   | Rob first house |
| 1     | 7     | 0 + 7 = 7      | max(0, 2) = 2       | Rob 1, skip 0; or skip 1 |
| 2     | 9     | 2 + 9 = 11     | max(7, 2) = 7       | Rob 2, skip 1; or skip 2 |
| 3     | 3     | 7 + 3 = 10     | max(11, 7) = 11     | Rob 3, skip 2; or skip 3 |
| 4     | 1     | 11 + 1 = 12    | max(11, 10) = 11    | Rob 4, skip 3; or skip 4 |


At the end, we return:

```python
max(rob, not_rob) = max(12, 11) = 12
```

##### Implementation
We use two variables to keep track of:
- `rob_amount`: max money if we rob the current house.
- `not_rob_amount`: max money if we skip the current house.

We update these as we iterate through the houses:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def rob(nums):
    rob_amount = 0
    not_rob_amount = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # if rob this i-th house
        if i == 0:
            rob_amount += nums[i]
        else:
            amount_if_rob = not_rob_amount + nums[i]
            not_rob_amount = max(rob_amount, not_rob_amount)
            rob_amount = amount_if_rob
    return max(not_rob_amount, rob_amount)
{% endhighlight %}

This solution is efficient and passes all test cases. It runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** space.
