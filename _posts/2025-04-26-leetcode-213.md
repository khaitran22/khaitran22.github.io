A notes on the Problem #213 - House Robber II on Leetcode when I practiced Dynamic Programming.

### Question
> YYou are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
> 
> Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without **alerting the police***.

**Example 1**:
- Input: `nums = [2,3,2]`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

**Example 2**:
- Input: `nums = [1,2,3,1]`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 3**:
- Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`
- Output: `3`

### Intuition
This problem is an expansion of the Problem #198 - House Robber where they add an addition restriction that all houses form a circle (i.e., the last house is a neighbor the first house). Thus we can just adapt [the code of the Problem #198](https://khaitran22.github.io/blog/2025/leetcode-198/) for this problem.

### Approach
There are also two approaches same as the problem #198:
- **Brute-force approach**
- **Dynamic Programming (DP) approach**

#### Brute-force Approach
In the problem #198, the brute-force approach as below:
> This approach considers all valid combinations of houses that can be robbed without triggering the alarm system. To do this, I generated all binary lists of length `n`, where each element is either `0` or `1`. A `1` at position `i` indicates that the `i-th` house is robbed, and `0` means it’s skipped. To ensure we don’t rob two adjacent houses, we filter out any combinations where two `1`s are next to each other.

Now the approach is extended to exclude the binary vector where the first and the last element are `1`s to take into account for the additional restriction. Thus, I just added an additional code block before `return result`:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def generate_binary_lists(n):
    result = [[0], [1]]
    for _ in range(1, n):
        new_result = []
        for lst in result:
            if lst[-1] == 1:
                new_result.append(lst + [0])
            else:
                new_result.append(lst + [1])
                new_result.append(lst + [0])
        result = new_result
    for i, lst in enumerate(result):
        if len(lst) > 1:
            if lst[0] * lst[-1] != 0:
                result.pop(i)
    return result
{% endhighlight %}

Next step is the same as I did in the Problem #198

This approach worked for **52 out of 75** test cases on LeetCode.

#### Dynamic Programming Approach
The DP approach is also an expansion of the same approach in the problem #198.

##### Observation
At any house `i`, you have two choices:
1. *Rob house `i`*: You must skip house `i-1`, so the total is the value at house `i` plus the max value when house `i-1` wasn’t robbed.
2. *Skip house `i`*: You take the max of robbing or skipping house `i-1`.

##### Step-by-Step Example

Let’s walk through the array `[2, 7, 9, 3, 1]`.

| House | Value | rob (rob this) | not_rob (skip this) | Explanation |
|:------|:------|:---------------|:--------------------|:------------|
| 0     | 2     | 2              | 0                   | Rob first house |
| 1     | 7     | 0 + 7 = 7      | max(0, 2) = 2       | Rob 1, skip 0; or skip 1 |
| 2     | 9     | 2 + 9 = 11     | max(7, 2) = 7       | Rob 2, skip 1; or skip 2 |
| 3     | 3     | 7 + 3 = 10     | max(11, 7) = 11     | Rob 3, skip 2; or skip 3 |
| 4     | 1     | 11 + 1 = 12    | max(11, 10) = 11    | Rob 4, skip 3; or skip 4 |


At the end, we return:

```python
max(rob, not_rob) = max(12, 11) = 12
```

##### Implementation
We use two variables to keep track of:
- `rob_amount`: max money if we rob the current house.
- `not_rob_amount`: max money if we skip the current house.

We update these as we iterate through the houses:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def rob(nums):
    rob_amount = 0
    not_rob_amount = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # if rob this i-th house
        if i == 0:
            rob_amount += nums[i]
        else:
            amount_if_rob = not_rob_amount + nums[i]
            not_rob_amount = max(rob_amount, not_rob_amount)
            rob_amount = amount_if_rob
    return max(not_rob_amount, rob_amount)
{% endhighlight %}

This solution is efficient and passes all test cases. It runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** space.
